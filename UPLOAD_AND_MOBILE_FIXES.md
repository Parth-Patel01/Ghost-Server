# Upload Error Fix & Mobile Responsiveness Update ðŸ“±ðŸ”§

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Upload Error: "Session ID, chunk index, and chunk data are required"
**Problem**: The chunked file upload was failing because the multer middleware was not properly configured.

**Root Cause**: The multer middleware was being attached to the upload route **after** the route was already defined, causing chunk uploads to fail.

**Solution**: Moved the multer configuration to the `setupRoutes()` method to ensure it's applied before the route is defined.

### 2. Mobile Responsiveness
**Problem**: The UI was not mobile-friendly and difficult to use on small screens.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive mobile-responsive design across all components.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes Applied

### Server-Side Fix (Upload Error)

#### Before:
```javascript
// In setupRoutes()
this.app.post('/api/upload/chunk', this.uploadChunk.bind(this));

// In start() method (executed later)
const upload = multer({
    storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
    limits: { fileSize: config.upload.chunkSize * 2 }
});
this.app.post('/api/upload/chunk', upload.single('chunk'), this.uploadChunk.bind(this));
```

#### After:
```javascript
// In setupRoutes() 
const upload = multer({
    storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
    limits: { fileSize: config.upload.chunkSize * 2 }
});
this.app.post('/api/upload/chunk', upload.single('chunk'), this.uploadChunk.bind(this));
```
