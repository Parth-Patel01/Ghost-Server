# Pi Media Server - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Complete

I have successfully implemented the complete **Pi Media Server** system according to your detailed project plan. This is a fully functional local media streaming service designed specifically for Raspberry Pi 5.

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. Backend Architecture (Node.js + Express)
- **Upload Server** (`src/server.js`) - Port 3000
  - Chunked file upload with session management
  - Movie metadata parsing from filenames
  - Real-time upload progress tracking
  - SQLite database integration
  - Redis job queue integration

- **Media Streaming Server** (`src/media-server.js`) - Port 80
  - Byte-range support for instant video seeking
  - HLS playlist and segment serving
  - Poster image serving
  - CORS and caching headers

- **Media Processing Worker** (`src/worker.js`)
  - Background ffmpeg processing using Redis queues
  - Automatic poster generation (1:30 timestamp)
  - HLS segment creation for smooth streaming
  - Progress tracking and error handling

### 2. Database Layer (SQLite)
- **Schema** (`src/db/schema.sql`)
  - Movies table with metadata and status tracking
  - Upload sessions table for chunked uploads
  - Proper indexing and triggers

- **Database Class** (`src/db/database.js`)
  - Full CRUD operations for movies
  - Upload session management
  - Connection pooling and error handling

### 3. Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)
- **Modern Upload Interface** (`frontend/src/pages/Upload.jsx`)
  - Drag-and-drop multi-file upload
  - Real-time progress bars
  - Chunked upload with retry logic
  - File validation and error handling

- **Movie Library** (`frontend/src/pages/Library.jsx`)
  - Responsive grid layout with poster thumbnails
  - Status filtering (all, ready, processing, uploading, error)
  - Delete functionality
  - Auto-refresh for processing updates

- **Custom Video Player** (`frontend/src/pages/Player.jsx`)
  - HLS.js integration with MP4 fallback
  - Custom controls with seeking, volume, fullscreen
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Space, arrows, M, F)
  - Auto-hiding controls

### 4. Utility Functions
- **Movie Parser** (`src/utils/movieParser.js`)
  - Intelligent filename parsing for titles and years
  - File validation and sanitization
  - Size formatting and duration helpers

- **API Client** (`frontend/src/utils/api.js`)
  - Axios-based API client with error handling
  - Upload, movie, and status endpoints
  - Request/response interceptors

### 5. Production Deployment
- **Systemd Services** (`scripts/services/`)
  - Upload service (pi-media-upload.service)
  - Streaming service (pi-media-stream.service)
  - Worker service (pi-media-worker.service)
  - Proper resource limits and restart policies

- **Installation Script** (`scripts/install.sh`)
  - Automated system setup
  - Dependency installation (Node.js, Redis, ffmpeg, nginx)
  - Service configuration and startup
  - Network and storage setup

### 6. Configuration System
- **Centralized Config** (`config/default.js`)
  - Network settings (Pi IP, ports)
  - Upload limits and chunk sizes
  - Processing parameters
  - Security settings

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### File Flow
1. **Upload**: Files chunked and uploaded to temp directory
2. **Assembly**: Chunks combined into final movie file
3. **Processing**: Background worker generates poster and HLS segments
4. **Storage**: Organized in `/media/movies/Title.Year/` structure
5. **Streaming**: Served with byte-range support for instant seeking

### Concurrency Design
- **5+ simultaneous uploads** with chunked transfer
- **5+ concurrent streams** with byte-range support
- **2 concurrent processing jobs** to prevent CPU overload
- **Redis queues** for reliable background processing

### Network Architecture
- **Upload UI**: Port 3000 (React app + upload API)
- **Media Streaming**: Port 80 (direct file serving)
- **Database**: SQLite for metadata storage
- **Queue**: Redis for job management

## 🎯 Key Features Delivered

✅ **Chunked Upload System** - Reliable large file uploads with resume capability  
✅ **Automatic Processing** - ffmpeg poster and HLS generation  
✅ **Smart Metadata** - Title/year parsing from filenames  
✅ **Custom Video Player** - HLS.js with custom controls  
✅ **Byte-Range Streaming** - Instant seeking for smooth playback  
✅ **Concurrent Operations** - Multiple uploads and streams simultaneously  
✅ **Professional UI** - Modern React interface with Tailwind CSS  
✅ **Production Ready** - Systemd services with monitoring and logging  
✅ **Local Network Only** - Complete offline operation  
✅ **Raspberry Pi Optimized** - Efficient resource usage for Pi 5
